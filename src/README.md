# Overview

This pakage provides an algorithim that can be used to find the shortest path from a given source vertext to all vertex.

The main point of this package is to implement  Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm using a min-heap.

There are other algorithms that can be implemented also.

You can clone the repository from GitHub and use pip3 to install it and use it in the python enviroment.
